## Algebra

**Introduction:** Envision algebra as the mystical language of the universe, a realm where symbols serve as keys to unlock the hidden relationships between numbers. It's not merely math but the poetry of logical thought made manifest.

**Definition:** Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses letters (variables) along with numbers to describe relationships and solve problems.

**Example:** Solving for x in 2x + 3 = 7 leads us to discover that x = 2.


## Variable

**Introduction:** Variables are the elusive treasures of algebra, represented by letters that hold the place for values yet to be discovered, akin to bottles adrift at sea, each bearing its own secret message.

**Definition:** A variable is a symbol used to represent an unknown quantity in mathematical expressions and equations.

**Example:** In x + 5 = 10, x is the variable.

## Constant

**Introduction:** Constants are the unwavering compass in the algebraic journey, fixed values that shine like stars, guiding us through equations and expressions.

**Definition:** A constant is a specific, fixed number that does not change within the scope of an equation or expression.

**Example:** In y = 3x + 4, 4 is the constant.

## Coefficient

**Introduction:** Imagine coefficients as the number of pirates in your variable crew, telling you how many similar treasures you've gathered, influencing the weight of your mathematical cargo.

**Definition:** A coefficient is a number that multiplies a variable, indicating the quantity of that variable in a term.

**Example:** In 7x, 7 is the coefficient of x.

## Term

**Introduction:** Terms are the individual islands of our algebraic archipelago, each a unique blend of numbers and variables, separated by the seas of addition or subtraction.

**Definition:** A term is a part of an algebraic expression separated by plus or minus signs, consisting of constants, variables, or both multiplied together.

**Example:** In 3x^2 + 2x + 1, 3x^2, 2x, and 1 are terms.

## Algebraic Expression

**Introduction:** Algebraic expressions are the narratives of numbers and variables, weaving together a story of relationships without the finality of an equals sign, the beginning of an adventure.

**Definition:** An algebraic expression is a combination of variables, numbers, and operations but without an equality sign.

**Example:** 4x - 5 is an algebraic expression.

## Equation

**Introduction:** Equations are the treasure maps of algebra, asserting equality between two expressions, with the equals sign as a bridge connecting lands of numeric and variable riches.

**Definition:** An equation is a mathematical statement that asserts the equality of two expressions, typically involving variables.

**Example:** 3x + 4 = 10 is an equation.

### Advanced Artifacts for NCEA Level 2 Buccaneers

## The Quadratic Equation

**Introduction:** Imagine the quadratic equation as the whirlpool of our algebraic adventure, where variables rise to the challenge of squaring up, inviting us to a duel of wits.

**Definition:** A quadratic equation is an equation of the form *ax^2+bx+c=0* where *a, b* and *c* are constants, and *a*=/=*0*, featuring a variable squared.

**Example:** *x^2*-5*x*+6=0

## Polynomial

**Introduction:** Polynomials are mighty fleets of terms, sailing in formation, from the humble monomial to the grand structures of binomials and trinomials.

**Definition:** A polynomial is an expression of finite length constructed from variables and constants, using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents.

**Example:** *x^3-4x+7*

## Function

**Introduction:** Functions are the ships that chart our course from input to output, ensuring no value is lost in the mathematical mists.

**Definition:** A function is a relation that assigns exactly one output to each input.

**Example:** For the function *F*(*x*)=2*x*+3, inputting *x*=2 yields an outupt of 7.

## Linear Function

**Introduction:** Linear functions chart as straight as the horizon, where *y=mx+b* marks the journey's path, clear as day.

**Definition:** A linear function is a function where the graph forms a straight line, defined by the equation *y=mx+b* with *m* representing the slope and the *b* the y-intercept

**Example:** *y=3x+1*.

## Exponentiation

**Introduction:** Exponentiation catches the wind in our sails, multiplying our variable by itself, propelling us to new mathematical heights.

**Definition:** Exponentiation is an operation where a number (the base) is multiplied by itself a certain number of times, indicated by another number (the exponent).

**Example:** 2^3=8.

## Logarithms

**Introduction:** Logarithms guide us back from the lofty exponents, asking how many times a base must be multiplied by itself to reach a given number.

**Definition:** A logarithm determines the exponent to which a base must be raised to produce a given number.

## Rational Expressions

**Introduction:** Rational expressions navigate the waters of fractions where, instead of mere numbers, entire expressions fill the sails above and below.

**Definition:** A rational expression is a fraction in which both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials.

## Systems of Equations

**Introduction:** When multiple maps lay claim to the same treasure, solving systems of equations is like piecing together competing legends, no solution left behind.

**Definition:** A system of equations is a set of two or more equations with the same variables, solved together.

**Example:** Solving *x+y=5* and *x-y=1* simultaneously.
